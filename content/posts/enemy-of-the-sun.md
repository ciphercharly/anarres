by Samih al-Qasim   
(from *Enemy of the Sun: Poetry of Palestinian Resistance*, Edited by Naseer Aruri and Edmund Ghareeb, Drum and Spear Press, 1970. The collection will be reissued by Seven Stories Press in February 2025.)  

I may – if you wish – lose my livelihood  
I may sell my shirt and bed.  
I may work as a stone cutter,  
A street sweeper, a porter.  
I may clean your stores  
Or rummage your garbage for food.  
I may lie down hungry,  
O enemy of the sun,  
But  
I shall not compromise  
And to the last pulse in my veins  
I shall resist.  

You may take the last strip of my land,  
Feed my youth to prison cells.  
You may plunder my heritage.  
You may burn my books, my poems  
Or feed my flesh to the dogs.  
You may spread a web of terror  
On the roofs of my village,  
O enemy of the sun,  
But  
I shall not compromise  
And to the last pulse in my veins  
I shall resist.  

You may put out the light in my eyes.  
You may deprive me of my mother’s kisses.  
You may curse my father, my people.  
You may distort my history,  
You may deprive my children of a smile  
And of life’s necessities.  
You may fool my friends with a borrowed face.  
You may build walls of hatred around me.  
You may glue my eyes to humiliations,  
O enemy of the sun,  
But  

I shall not compromise  
And to the last pulse in my veins  
I shall resist.  
O enemy of the sun  
The decorations are raised at the port.  
The ejaculations fill the air,  
A glow in the hearts,  
And in the horizon  
A sail is seen  
Challenging the wind  
And the depths.  
It is Ulysses  
Returning home  
From the sea of loss  

It is the return of the sun,  
Of my exiled ones  
And for her sake, and his  
I swear  
I shall not compromise  
And to the last pulse in my veins  
I shall resist,  
Resist—and resist.
